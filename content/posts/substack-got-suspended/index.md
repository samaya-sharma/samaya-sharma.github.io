Just a couple months ago, I had written ```I just store my posts over at Substack here. Though it’s unlikely that I write anything that is offensive enough for me to lose access to them, it’s still nice to have a copy.``` when setting up a copy of my Substack posts here. Well today (2026-02-12), my account got suspended. I don't know why. I've sent an appeal. Let's see what happens.

I hope it will get unsuspeneded soon. Still, I can access the posts themselves. I had previously backed up 2 posts here but will do all of them now.
