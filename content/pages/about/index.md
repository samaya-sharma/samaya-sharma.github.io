My name is **Samayaśarmmā** . I like old languages and old literature. I know Sanskrit and Latin with some competence. My knowledge of Ancient Greek is not as good as the prior two but is still alright. I know enough Old English and Old Norse to get by. I post my writings here. Mostly Sanskrit but some Latin and Old Norse.
